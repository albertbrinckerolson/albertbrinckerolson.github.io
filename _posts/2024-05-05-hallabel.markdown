%intro

In this project we will take a look at the Copenhagen residential prices from 2000 to 2024. The aim is to gain insight into how the housing prices have changed over time and across space. Notably some important events are contained within our temporal period, mainly the 2008 economic crash and the covid-19 pandemic. 

% Dataset
As far as we know, a comprehensive dataset of all housing sales from 2000 - 2024 is not publicly available. To remedy this we have opted to scrape our data from "boligsiden.dk". Scraping from this side gives us access to variables from Bygnings og Bolig-registeret(BBR). In total we have gathered 2889191 recorded sales from the municipalities of Copenhagen and Frederiksberg. For each recorded sale we obtain 5 variables: longitude, latitude, neighbourhood, date and squaremeterprice. Furthermore we have also obtained some shapefiles describing the neighbourhood borders, in order to produce visualizations that highlight the price change in the different regions of the city

To gain insight into where the different vehicle types are stolen from, we plot the locations on a map of San Francisco, where the thefts are colored by vehicle types. The map is shown below. Upon inspection we see that overall, the

    <p>  Another question that arises about the data is which times throughout the day are the vehicles stolen and does this differ from the different vehicle types? The graph below is constructed by counting stolen vehicles of each type within each hour of the day. Overall the thefts are most common between 16:00 to 24:00.

    <p>
      There is also a noticeable spike at 12:00 - 13:00. This is possibly due to 12:00 being a default time for thefts where the time is not known. Looking at the individual vehicles, we see a similar pattern for each of them, with the exception of miscellaneous. This is most likely due to the low number of samples compared to the rest

Overall, the thefts of different vehicle types are quite similar in terms of their distribution in time and space. The only major difference is the number of occurrences, where automobiles are the most commonly stolen vehicle type, followed by trucks, motorcycles and miscellaneous.
